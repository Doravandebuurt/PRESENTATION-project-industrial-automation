Process:​
- Pressure (of the press) between 2 - 6,5 bar ​
- Time pressed: 20 sec​
- Temperature of the material: 150 – 170°C​

​

Learning outcomes:​
- Almost completely smooth, compact, and flat​
- Minor surface defects​
- The thinner, the less surface defects​
- Uniform thickness across the plate​
- Small expansion while cooling


## Second test made: rolling

Process:​
- Manual rolling​
- Roller material: teflon​
- Two rails to controll thickness​
- Temperature of the material: 150-170°C​
- Execution time: 30-40 sec


Learning outcomes:​
- Plate geometry not controlled​
- Significant thickness variation across the plate​
- Material difficult to roll​
- Rolled section exhibits a smooth, compact surface
